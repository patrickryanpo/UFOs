# UFOs

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this analysis is to represent and filter through a list of UFO sightings. The web application has the capability of filtering through date, city, state, country, and shape. The user of this web application is able to narrow down information based on these filtering criteria. 

## Results
Upon loading the page, the web app user will see a list of all the UFO sightings data available. In order to generate the data required, the user may type preferred values inside the "Filter Search" fields. 

For example: 

I would like to look up UFO sightings that have the following criteria:

City: ceres
State: ca
Country: us
Shape: fireball

Based on these fields, it shows me that there was one sighting on 1/12/2010, which lasted for about 30 seconds.

## Summary 
One of the drawbacks of this web application is that there is not enough flexibility when it comes to case recognition or character recognition. 

Using the same criteria, when I type in "US" in uppercase instead of lowercase, the matching fields do not show.

In the same way that the date field does not accept formatting that is different from the data being filtered.

# Recommendations
1. For the filter fields to be adaptable to different cases and formatting. In the example above, the filtering fields should be able to recognize "US" and "us" as the same. 

2. This web application could be improved by allowing for users to enter multiple filter criteria per field. This would allow users to gather data from the web application more efficiently.
